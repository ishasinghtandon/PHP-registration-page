# PHP-registration-page

Design a fully functional flow of a typical user registration and login page.
It should have a responsive UI
The registration page should record user data such as, Name, Email ID, Password, Address, Phone number
The login page should validate the user based on Email and Password used while registering
Use the PHP-MySQLi (Object-oriented or procedural style is upto you) library for interfacing with the Database backend
Use MySQL database server to persist the data.


# 1. Create the MySQL Database:

Create a MySQL database named user_registration and a table named users with columns id, name, email, password, address, and phone.

# 2. Create the Registration Page (register.php)

# 3. Create the Registration Process (register_process.php)

# 4. Create the Login Page (login.php):

# 5. Create the Login Process (login_process.php)
